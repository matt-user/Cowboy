# Cowboy
Ethereum dapp that simulates the game of cowboy. (IN PROGRESS)

Rules
The game is played by 2 players and ends when one shoots the other.  Both players start with no ammo.  On each turn of the game players can either shoot, reload, or dodge.  Shooting subtracts 1 from the players ammo and ends the game if the other player is reloading, and players can not shoot if they have no ammo.  Reloading adds 1 to the players ammo.  This allows players to reload multiple times to stack ammo. Dodging allows one player to dodge the other player's shots.  If Player1 shoots and Player 2 dodges then Player2 stays alive.
